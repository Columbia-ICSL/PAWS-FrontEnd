# README #

This folder contains the firmware and source code used to generate it for the STM32f4 MCU, used for extraction car location features, in the PAWS headset.

The firmware used in the PAWS system can be found in **./MDK-ARM/STM32F446xx/STM32F446xx.hex**.

Instructions on building your own source code and required libraries for the STM32f4 MCU for feature extraction can be found in the [STM website](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f446re.html).

The original README included with the STM32f4 project can be found in the **readme.txt** file.

* Note: The PAWS project was at some point known as SEUS, which is why SEUS is used at some points rather than PAWS.
