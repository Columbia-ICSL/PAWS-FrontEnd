This folder contains the firmware and source code used to generate it for the Nordic nRF52 Chip, used for BLE communication with the smartphone, in the PAWS LE system.

The firmware for the Nordic nRF52 chip used in the PAWS LE system can be found in **./pca10040/s132/arm5_no_packs/_build/nrf52832_xxaa.hex**.

Instructions on building your own source code and required libraries for the Nordic nRF52 Chip for wireless transmission can be found in the [Nordic website](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp).
The SDK used to develop this project was the **nRF5 SDK v12.0.0** with SoftDevice **S132 v3.0.0**.

* Note: The PAWS project was at some point known as SEUS, which is why SEUS is used at some points rather than PAWS.
